Current Project: Recreate a copy of the HTML and CSS of the Google homepage.
Skills:
-Basic knowledge of HTML structure including divs and forms.
-Basic knowledge of CSS styling including flexbox and simple responsive design.
-Basic knowledge of Developer Tools for both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome including inspecting elements and CSS, testing responsiveness across different platforms, and editing in real-time to increase time efficiency and productivity.
Self-Reflection:
-Recreating websites is an excellent way to build fluency in various languages without having to waste time creating filler content.
-This project's website is not built to accommodate the majority of accessibility needs - if I have time, I'd like to come back and update the project with built-in accessibility.
-When using the developer tools, I found the navigation bar and footer rendered uncomfortably small on mobile/tablet devices, so again, if I have time, I would come back and make adjustments either via media query or more relative positioning/measure units.
